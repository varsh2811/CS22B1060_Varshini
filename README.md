🔐 AES-256 Encryption in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** for academic purposes. The project demonstrates secure encryption and decryption using **AES-256 in Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode**.

🧠 Project Overview

This implementation shows how to:

- Generate strong encryption keys.
- Perform AES encryption for plaintext data
- Decrypt the ciphertext using the same key and IV
- Encode and decode the ciphertext with Base64 for transmission

🔐 Why AES-256 + CFB Mode?

- **AES-256** offers strong encryption with a large key size, making brute-force attacks impractical.
- **CFB mode** allows AES to operate as a stream cipher, making it suitable for variable-length messages without padding.
- **Base64 encoding** ensures the encrypted binary output is safe to display, transmit, or store.

🎓 Academic Use

This repository is created as part of an academic assignment for demonstrating symmetric-key encryption using AES in Python.
